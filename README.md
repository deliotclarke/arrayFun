# arrayFun
Let's get weird

Just wanted a chance to mess around with a couple of array functions in JavaScript, not unlike the ol' 
Cups and Balls trick. *insert upside smiley*
Sans of course the magician and maybe even a little fun. Could be cool to do a guess thing eventually with prompts or hiding balls 1-6 in three different arrays, user guesses, less a trick more a game of chance? Don't know what that would look like.
